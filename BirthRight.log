Birthright

Goal:
	A narritive driven side scrolling platformer revolving around a 
	physics engine that uses energy to gauge interactions.

Interesting aspects:
	Using energy as a base I can get a rough idea of how much to exaggerate scenes to make them feel heavy and intense. With energy as an intertwined mechanic I can explore how cinemaic player controlled gameplay is.

	I want to explore subtle narritive driven stories that have a streamlined plot but the characters mannurism shift if the player does poorly throughout the game, not changing the ending but changing how the protagonist responds to it.

	Using two protagonist to explore both types of playstyles, using "magic" energy in movement for one and giving him strong attacks, and limiting attacks in the other but giving her free movement.

	Theme Noridc with locations found in iceland and opposing sides with the "Roman" Empire.
