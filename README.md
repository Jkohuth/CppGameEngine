# C++ Game Engine

To understand the foundational level of graphics programming that goes into making games I opted to use C++ with GLFW, GLEW, and OpenGL in order to produce a game engine. From generating the window context to creating the 3D scene and projecting the result on a 2D scene. To go as low level as possible I avoided using an IDE and did the project with Sublime Text 3 and a make file for compilation. It still is a work in progress.
